# ü§ñ CalMate ‚Äì Smart Google Calendar Booking Assistant

CalMate is a natural language-powered assistant that helps users **book meetings in their Google Calendar** using plain English like:

> "Schedule a call tomorrow at 3 PM"  
> "Book a meeting next Friday at 10 AM"  
> "Set a discussion for July 15 at 5 PM"

It uses **FastAPI** for backend processing, **LangGraph** for extracting time from natural text, and **Streamlit** for a beautiful conversational frontend UI.
